A lightweight package for easy IO in Python with minimal dependencies.

In particular, it allows to stream videos as list-like object of images (stored as ndarray) through a pipe and using ffmpeg. This package is mainly designed for my research so I don't have to installed heavy packages or dozens of dependencies when all I want is to experiment on some videos.
